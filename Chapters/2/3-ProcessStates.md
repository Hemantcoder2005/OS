# Process States 🎭

Now that we know what a process is and how it gets created, let’s dive into the various states a process can be in. Think of it like the different moods someone can be in throughout a day. 🌞🌙

- **Running** 🏃‍♂️:
  - The process is actively using the CPU, like a student who’s fully awake and cramming for an exam. 🧠📚

- **Sleeping** 😴:
  - The process is waiting for something to happen before it can continue. Picture it as a student taking a nap while waiting for a group project meeting to start. 💤📅

- **Zombie** 🧟‍♂️:
  - The process has finished its work but hasn’t been properly cleaned up yet because its parent process hasn’t acknowledged its end. It’s like finishing a task but still waiting for your teacher to grade it. 📝📉

- **Stopped** 🛑:
  - The process has been paused by a signal and is waiting to be resumed. Imagine someone hitting the pause button on your favorite TV show—you’re just waiting for it to play again! 📺⏸️

- **Dead** 💀:
  - The process has finished execution and is done for good. It’s like a retired player who has hung up their boots and is enjoying their time off. 🏅🌴

- **Waiting** ⏳:
  - The process is waiting for a resource or event, like waiting in line for a popular food truck. 🍔⏰

- **Tracing Stop** 🕵️‍♂️:
  - The process is under observation and has been stopped temporarily. It’s like being on a reality TV show where the cameras are always on you, and you’re momentarily paused for the next scene. 🎥🚧

- **Idle** 💤:
  - The process isn’t doing much and is just waiting for something to happen. It’s like a couch potato waiting for the next episode of their favorite series. 🛋️📺

- **New** 🆕:
  - The process is in the creation phase, like a newborn baby just coming into the world. It’s getting ready to start its life journey. 👶✨

- **Exit** 🚪:
  - The process is in the process of wrapping things up and exiting. It’s like saying goodbye at the end of a party and heading out the door. 🎉👋

And there you have it—the various states a process can be in, each with its own unique vibe! 🎭
