# Mechanism: Limited Direct Execution 🚀💻

So, the OS wants to share the **physical CPU** among many jobs running at the same time. It’s like trying to be the host of a dinner party but only having one plate 🍽️ for all your guests. The solution? **Take turns**! 🍕🧁

### The Big Idea 💡
- **Run one process** for a little while (Process A is getting some pizza 🍕).
- Then **run another process** for a bit (Process B gets the dessert 🍰).
- Keep switching like this, and it *feels* like everyone’s eating at the same time. **Voila! Virtualization!** 🎉

### But Wait! Challenges Ahead 🛑
There are some hiccups here:
1. **Performance** 🏎️: We need to switch between these processes FAST. It’s like trying to pass the pizza without dropping it!
2. **Control** 🎮: The OS must stay in charge, or one process could hog all the pizza! 🍕➡️🍕➡️🍕 (not cool). Worse, it could sneak into the kitchen and steal dessert 🍰 it’s not supposed to have! 😱

### The Crux 🧐
#### *How can the OS efficiently share the CPU while keeping control like a pro?*
The OS needs to balance between **speedy service** ⏱️ and keeping the CPU under **tight control** like a ninja 🥷. That way, no rogue process can take over the whole machine and start causing chaos. 😈

### The Secret Sauce 🤫
The OS will need some **hardware help** 🛠️ to make sure everything runs smoothly. It’s like having a bouncer at the kitchen door 👮 to make sure no one eats all the cake 🎂.

And there you go! Efficient CPU virtualization, with a little help from our hardware friends! 😎🤖
