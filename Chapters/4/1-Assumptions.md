# 📊 Workload Assumptions: The Basics of Scheduling 🛠️

Welcome to the section where we dive into the assumptions that make our scheduling policies tick! Think of this as setting up the stage for our scheduling drama. 🎭 Let's break down these assumptions with a sprinkle of humor and a dash of reality-check!

## 🤓 The Workload Assumptions: Simplified for Your Pleasure

Before we get into the weeds of scheduling policies, let’s lay down some ground rules about the processes (or jobs) that will be running in our system. These are our “ideal” scenarios, which will help us understand how things might work in a perfect world. 🌍✨

### 1. ⏲️ **Uniform Job Duration**
- **Assumption:** Every job runs for exactly the same amount of time.
- **Reality Check:** In the real world, some jobs take forever, while others are done in a jiffy. 🕰️🔄

### 2. 🚪 **Simultaneous Arrival**
- **Assumption:** All jobs arrive at the same time.
- **Reality Check:** Imagine all your tasks showing up at your door simultaneously. Talk about a scheduling nightmare! 📬😱

### 3. 🏃‍♂️ **Run to Completion**
- **Assumption:** Once a job starts, it runs to completion without interruptions.
- **Reality Check:** In real life, interruptions are the norm. But here, we’re in a perfect world where tasks never get sidetracked! 🔄🚫

### 4. 💻 **CPU-Only Jobs**
- **Assumption:** Jobs only use the CPU and perform no I/O operations.
- **Reality Check:** In the wild, jobs often need to interact with other system resources. But let’s pretend our jobs are super self-sufficient. 🌐🤖

### 5. 🧠 **Known Run-Time**
- **Assumption:** The run-time of each job is known in advance.
- **Reality Check:** If we knew exactly how long each task would take, we’d be like scheduling wizards. Sadly, that’s not the case in the real world. 🧙‍♂️✨

## 🕵️‍♂️ Reality Check: The Omniscient Scheduler

While our assumptions might seem like a scheduling fairy tale, they help us understand basic principles. And just like some animals are “more equal” in Orwell's *Animal Farm*, some assumptions are “more unrealistic” than others here. But fear not, as we’ll eventually relax these assumptions to build a fully-operational scheduling discipline! 🚀🎯

So, buckle up as we embark on this journey of scheduling policies! And remember, even if our assumptions are a bit out there, they pave the way for the ultimate scheduling wisdom. 🌟📅
