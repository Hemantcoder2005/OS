# 📏 Scheduling Metrics: Measuring Success 🏆

Welcome to the world of scheduling metrics! If you’re wondering how we measure the success of our scheduling policies, you’re in the right place. Let’s break it down with a sprinkle of humor. 🎯😄

## 🎯 What’s a Scheduling Metric?

A scheduling metric is like a report card for your scheduling policies. It tells us how well our scheduling is performing. 📊

### 🕒 **Turnaround Time: Our Star Metric**

- **Definition:** Turnaround time is the time it takes for a job to finish after it arrives. In simple terms: 

  `T_turnaround = T_completion - T_arrival`

- **Simplified:** Since we’re assuming all jobs arrive at the same time, `T_arrival = 0`, so:

  `T_turnaround = T_completion`

  Voilà! 🎉

### 📈 **Why Focus on Turnaround Time?**

- **Performance Metric:** Turnaround time helps us see how quickly our system handles jobs. Faster turnaround means better performance. 🚀

### ⚖️ **The Fairness Factor**

- **Fairness vs. Performance:** Sometimes, trying to optimize performance can lead to fairness issues. For example, speeding up some jobs might slow down others. Balancing both is key! ⚖️
