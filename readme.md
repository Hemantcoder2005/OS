# Welcome to Operating System Course

Hi! I'm Hemant Narula from IIITD, class of 2027 (CSAI). I created this OS repository to help understand the fundamentals of Operating Systems in a fun and engaging way. This is a collaborative space where we can explore the core concepts of OS together, with hands-on examples and projects.

Let's dive deep and learn! ðŸš€
